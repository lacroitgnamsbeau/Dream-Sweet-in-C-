This will be our github repository for the project in CSCE A201.

I divided the flow of the project into 4 weeks.

Concept: Task-Track RPG

Basically the user will name their task, assign a level of difficulty on it (Maybe 1-3 or 1-5?), and add a timer on it.
Should we give the player a choice to pause and unpause the timer? Need some input on this.
After that, we can input some base values on different difficulties of stages, bosses, etc.
The task priority will serve as an additional multiplier for the player's base damage.
Some weapon items could be:
  1. Pencil
  2. Sharpener
  3. Eraser
  4. Some stationery stuff or whatever
We can add some skills to those weapons too like
  1. Pencil - Skill: Stab
  2. Sharpener - Skill: Enhances attack and crit chance for a limited amount of time
  3. Eraser - Skill: Nullify incoming damage for a limited amount of time
